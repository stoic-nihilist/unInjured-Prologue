Hello.
Creator here.

I hope you'll find this game as fun to play as it was for me to create it in the 4 days it took.

For those of you familiar with programming, Terminal controls and compilers, you know what to do.
For those of you that don't, instructions for running this game are simple.

Open a Terminal, navigate to game folder, enter "javac Main.java" and after the brief compilation, enter "java Main" each time you wish to run the game.

If you don't run from the 'Main' file, the game might crash or you may lack proper context to play.

Enjoy this simple text-based game. 
(Feel free to change it; it's open source, but only if you're familiar with Java as a language.)
More on the way.

Peace, out.
